# Active Context: ESAT Dashboard (Initialization Phase)

## Current Focus

The primary focus has been establishing the foundational structure of the `esat-dashboard` project. This involved:
*   Setting up the Nuxt 3 project.
*   Configuring environment variables for database connection.
*   Integrating Kysely as the type-safe query builder.
*   Creating a basic API endpoint (`/api/esats`) to test the database connection.
*   Initializing the core Memory Bank documentation.

## Current Focus

Developing the core API endpoints for managing ESAT data. Starting with full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the `esats` entity.

## Recent Changes

*   **Fixed DB Connection:** Resolved the `runtimeConfig` validation issue in `server/utils/db.ts` that incorrectly flagged empty passwords as missing configuration. The application now connects to the database successfully.
*   **Verified Setup:** Confirmed the Nuxt 3 project, Kysely integration, and database connection are working as expected.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **Implement ESAT CRUD API:**
    *   Modify `server/api/esats.get.ts` to fetch all ESATs.
    *   Create `server/api/esats/[id].get.ts` to fetch a single ESAT.
    *   Create `server/api/esats.post.ts` to create a new ESAT.
    *   Create `server/api/esats/[id].put.ts` to update an ESAT.
    *   Create `server/api/esats/[id].delete.ts` to delete an ESAT.
2.  **Update Schema/Types (If Necessary):** Review and potentially update the `EsatTable` interface in `server/utils/db.ts` if the actual database schema differs significantly from the placeholder.
3.  **Update Memory Bank:** Document the implemented API endpoints in `progress.md` and `systemPatterns.md`.

## Key Decisions/Patterns Confirmed

*   Nuxt 3 as the full-stack framework.
*   MySQL as the database.
*   Kysely for type-safe database access.
*   Environment variables (`.env`) for configuration, accessed server-side via Nuxt's `runtimeConfig`.
*   Centralized database utility (`db.ts`).
*   Nuxt server routes for the API.
*   Memory Bank for project documentation.
