# Active Context: ESAT Dashboard (Frontend Development Phase)

## Current Focus

The project has progressed from the API development phase to frontend implementation. The current focus is on:
*   Building a responsive and user-friendly interface for the dashboard.
*   Implementing CRUD operations in the UI for all core entities.
*   Connecting the frontend components to the API endpoints.
*   Ensuring a consistent user experience across the application.
*   Documenting progress and patterns in the Memory Bank.

## Recent Changes

*   **Created Application Layout:** Implemented a responsive layout with navigation in `layouts/default.vue`.
*   **Implemented Dashboard:** Created a dashboard homepage in `pages/index.vue` showing entity counts and quick actions.
*   **Developed ESAT Management UI:** Built complete CRUD interface for ESATs:
    *   List view (`pages/esats/index.vue`) with delete confirmation modal
    *   Detail view (`pages/esats/[id].vue`) showing related users and workers
    *   Create form (`pages/esats/create.vue`) with validation
    *   Edit form (`pages/esats/[id]/edit.vue`) with data loading and update functionality
*   **Updated Documentation:** Kept Memory Bank files (`progress.md`) in sync with implementation progress.

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1.  **User Management UI:**
    *   Create list view (`pages/users/index.vue`)
    *   Implement detail view (`pages/users/[id].vue`)
    *   Build create form with password handling (`pages/users/create.vue`)
    *   Develop edit form (`pages/users/[id]/edit.vue`)
2.  **Worker Management UI:**
    *   Create list view (`pages/workers/index.vue`)
    *   Implement detail view (`pages/workers/[id].vue`)
    *   Build create form (`pages/workers/create.vue`)
    *   Develop edit form (`pages/workers/[id]/edit.vue`)
3.  **Authentication & Authorization:**
    *   Implement login page and functionality
    *   Add user session management
    *   Set up route guards based on user roles

## Key Decisions/Patterns Confirmed

*   **Architecture:** Nuxt 3 as the full-stack framework with server API routes.
*   **Database:** MySQL with Kysely for type-safe query building.
*   **API Structure:** Consistent RESTful CRUD pattern across all entities.
*   **Security:** Password hashing with bcrypt for user authentication.
*   **Configuration:** Environment variables via `.env` and Nuxt's `runtimeConfig`.
*   **Documentation:** Comprehensive Memory Bank for project knowledge persistence.
*   **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript interfaces for database tables and API operations.
*   **Validation:** Input validation for required fields and enum values.
*   **UI Patterns:**
    *   Consistent page structure with header actions
    *   Card-based content containers
    *   Form layout and validation approach
    *   Modal confirmation for destructive actions
    *   Loading and error state handling
    *   Responsive design using CSS Grid and Flexbox
