# Project Brief: ESAT Dashboard

## Core Goal

To create a web application dashboard (`esat-dashboard`) for managing ESAT (Ã‰tablissement et Service d'Aide par le Travail) related data, including information about ESATs, Users, and Workers.

    *   Database: MySQL
    *   ORM/Query Builder: Kysely
    *   Language: TypeScript
2.  **Functionality (Initial Setup):**
    *   Establish a Nuxt 3 project structure.
    *   Configure secure database connection using environment variables.
    *   Set up Kysely for type-safe database interactions.
    *   Create a basic API endpoint to verify database connectivity.
3.  **Target Audience:** Administrators or managers involved with ESAT operations.

## Project Scope (Initial)
