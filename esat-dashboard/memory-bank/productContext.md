# Product Context: ESAT Dashboard

## Problem Space

Managing data related to ESATs (Ã‰tablissements et Services d'Aide par le Travail), their associated users (staff), and workers (individuals receiving support) can be complex. Information might be scattered, difficult to access, or managed through inefficient processes (e.g., spreadsheets, manual tracking).

## Solution Vision

The `esat-dashboard` aims to provide a centralized, web-based platform to streamline the management of ESAT-related information. It will serve as a single source of truth, improving efficiency, data accuracy, and accessibility for authorized users.

## Core User Needs (High-Level)

*   **View:** Access lists and details of ESATs, users, and workers.
*   **Manage:** Create, update, and potentially deactivate/delete records (CRUD operations).
*   **Relate:** Understand the relationships between ESATs, users, and workers (e.g., which users belong to which ESAT, which workers are associated with an ESAT).
*   **Secure Access:** Ensure only authorized personnel can access and modify data, potentially with different permission levels (roles).

## User Experience Goals (Initial)

*   **Clarity:** Present information in a clear, organized manner.
*   **Efficiency:** Allow users to find and manage data quickly.
*   **Reliability:** Ensure data integrity and consistent performance.

*(This context will evolve as specific features are defined and developed.)*
