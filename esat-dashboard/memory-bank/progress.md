# Progress: ESAT Dashboard (Initialization Complete)

## What Works

*   **Project Structure:** Standard Nuxt 3 project created.
*   **Dependencies:** Core Nuxt, `kysely`, `mysql2`, `bcrypt`, `@types/bcrypt` installed.
*   **Environment Configuration:** `.env` structure in place, `runtimeConfig` correctly defined in `nuxt.config.ts`.
*   **Database Utility:** `server/utils/db.ts` initializes Kysely using `runtimeConfig`, defines placeholder types (including exported `UserTable`).
*   **Database Connection:** **Successfully established and verified.** The `runtimeConfig` validation issue is resolved.
*   **ESAT CRUD API (Complete):** Implemented GET (all), GET (by ID), POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints in `server/api/esats/`.
*   **User CRUD API (Complete):** Implemented GET (all), GET (by ID), POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints in `server/api/users/`, including password hashing with `bcrypt`.
*   **Worker CRUD API (Complete):** Implemented GET (all), GET (by ID), POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints in `server/api/workers/`, with validation for required fields and enum values.
*   **Frontend UI (In Progress):**
    *   **Layout:** Created a responsive layout with navigation in `layouts/default.vue`.
    *   **Dashboard:** Implemented a dashboard homepage in `pages/index.vue` showing stats and quick actions.
    *   **ESAT Management:** Created CRUD UI for ESATs (list, view, create, edit) in `pages/esats/`.
*   **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files created and updated.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

*   **Database Schema Implementation:** Finalize and implement the MySQL schema.
*   **Type Synchronization:** Update TypeScript interfaces in `server/utils/db.ts` to match the final schema.
*   **Frontend Development (Continue):**
    *   Complete User Management UI (list, view, create, edit).
    *   Complete Worker Management UI (list, view, create, edit).
    *   Implement responsive design improvements.
    *   Add form validation.
*   **Core Feature Development:**
    *   CRUD API endpoints for other entities (e.g., AI Evaluations, PPP Actions, etc.)
    *   Corresponding frontend components.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** 
    *   Implement login/logout functionality.
    *   Set up route guards based on user roles.
    *   Secure API endpoints.
*   **Error Handling & Validation:** Implement robust checks.
*   **Testing:** Add tests.
*   **Deployment:** Set up deployment.

## Current Status

The foundational setup is complete, database connection is working, and CRUD API endpoints for **ESATs**, **Users**, and **Workers** are implemented. The frontend development has begun with the implementation of the layout, dashboard, and ESAT management UI. **Development focus continues on building the remaining frontend components for Users and Workers management, and implementing authentication.**

## Known Issues

*   None currently identified related to the core setup.

## Project Evolution

This initial setup provides a solid, type-safe starting point for building the ESAT Dashboard application using Nuxt 3, Kysely, and MySQL.
