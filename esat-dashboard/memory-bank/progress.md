# Progress: ESAT Dashboard (Initialization Complete)

## What Works

*   **Project Structure:** Standard Nuxt 3 project created.
*   **Dependencies:** Core Nuxt, `kysely`, `mysql2` installed.
*   **Environment Configuration:** `.env` structure in place, `runtimeConfig` correctly defined in `nuxt.config.ts`.
*   **Database Utility:** `server/utils/db.ts` initializes Kysely using `runtimeConfig`, defines placeholder types.
*   **Database Connection:** **Successfully established and verified.** The `runtimeConfig` validation issue is resolved.
*   **Memory Bank:** Core documentation files created and updated.

## What's Left to Build (High-Level)

*   **Database Schema Implementation:** Finalize and implement the MySQL schema.
*   **Type Synchronization:** Update TypeScript interfaces in `server/utils/db.ts` to match the final schema.
*   **Core Feature Development:**
    *   **ESAT CRUD API (Complete):** Implemented GET (all), GET (by ID), POST, PUT, DELETE endpoints in `server/api/esats/`.
    *   CRUD API endpoints for Users, Workers, etc. (Next)
    *   Frontend pages and components.
*   **Authentication & Authorization:** Implement security.
*   **UI/UX Refinement:** Build the interface.
*   **Error Handling & Validation:** Implement robust checks.
*   **Testing:** Add tests.
*   **Deployment:** Set up deployment.

## Current Status

The foundational setup is complete and the database connection is working. **Development is now focused on building the API endpoints, starting with CRUD operations for ESATs.**

## Known Issues

*   None currently identified related to the core setup.

## Project Evolution

This initial setup provides a solid, type-safe starting point for building the ESAT Dashboard application using Nuxt 3, Kysely, and MySQL.
